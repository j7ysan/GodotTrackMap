# Track Creation:
## Creation and Node Usage:
The basis of creating the track relied greatly upon the use of spline curves and creating a simulated
path from such curves and the use of the specific node like 'Path3D'. By doing this and attaching a 3D 
element we were able to create a generated track, the background of such being supported by a 'MeshInstance3D2'
for the addition of more depth and contrast to the track's slight texture - which was provided separately, using
a stock image. This texture could also be later replaced with a shader to utilize more of the class features explored.

---------------------------------------------------------
# Track Utilization:
The track is used in a way so that the player is guided down a set path, one that is not too long and not too short.
Along the track the transparent walls allow the player to look out onto the landscape whilst also performing the minigame
at hand. During the minigame the track is used as a progression tool, with the individual node segments of the track acting as
progress markers such as, 1 - 0%, 2 - 25%, 3 - 50%, 4 - 75%, 5 - 100%, and perfectly set up as to split it up in even segments.
