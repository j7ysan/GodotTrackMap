# Track Creation:
## Creation and Node Usage:
The basis of creating the track relied greatly upon the use of spline curves and creating a simulated
path from such curves and the use of the specific node like 'Path3D'. By doing this and attaching a 3D 
element we were able to create a generated track, the background of such being supported by a 'MeshInstance3D2'
for the addition of more depth and contrast to the track's slight texture - which was provided separately, using
a stock image. This texture could also be later replaced with a shader to utilize more of the class features explored.
